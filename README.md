# pulp_cluster

The `pulp_cluster` repository contains the structure of the cluster subsystem used in PULP chips.
For more details on the internal architecture, see the README.md in the
[`pulp` repository](https://github.com/pulp-platform/pulp).

The `doc` folder contains a draw.io schematic, as well as a .pdf of that schematic, outlining the most important components in pulp_cluster, as well as the communication interfaces connecting these. While not a complete overview of all signals, this is meant as a slightly more detailed overview that can assist in development.
